# Linux SSH Setup Guide for Beginners

This guide helps you set up SSH (Secure Shell) access on your Linux server. It includes two scripts that automate the setup process, making it easier for beginners to configure SSH securely.

What is SSH?

SSH (Secure Shell) is a secure way to connect to and manage your Linux server remotely. Instead of sitting physically at your server, you can connect to it from your local computer.

# Which Script Should I Use?
ssh-setup.sh: Use this if you want to connect from your Windows/Mac/Linux computer to your Linux server
ssh-user-to-root.sh: Use this if you're already on your Linux server and want to set up SSH access between a regular user and the root user
Prerequisites
A Linux server (Ubuntu, Debian, CentOS, etc.)
Basic knowledge of terminal commands
Root or sudo access on your server
SSH client on your local computer
Windows: Use PuTTY or Windows Terminal
Mac/Linux: Built-in terminal
Step-by-Step Guide: Connecting from Your Computer to Server
1. On Your Local Computer

Generate an SSH key pair:

# Windows (in PowerShell or Windows Terminal)
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096

# Mac/Linux
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096


Just press Enter for all prompts to use default settings.

2. Copy the Script to Your Server
# Download the script
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kadavilrahul/generate_ssh_keys/main/ssh-setup.sh

# Make it executable
chmod +x ssh-setup.sh

3. Copy Your Public Key to Server
# Windows
scp C:\Users\YourUsername\.ssh\id_rsa.pub username@server-ip:/tmp/

# Mac/Linux
scp ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub username@server-ip:/tmp/

4. Run the Setup Script
sudo ./ssh-setup.sh your-username /tmp/id_rsa.pub

5. Test Connection
ssh username@server-ip

Step-by-Step Guide: Setting Up User-to-Root Access

Use this if you want a regular user to be able to SSH into the root account on the same machine.

1. Get the Script
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kadavilrahul/generate_ssh_keys/main/ssh-user-to-root.sh
chmod +x ssh-user-to-root.sh


[Rest of the README remains the same...]

The main changes made were:

Updated the repository URL from yourusername/repo to kadavilrahul/generate_ssh_keys
Updated the raw file URLs to point to the correct repository
Kept all other content and formatting intact as it was well-structured and informative

The rest of the README content including the sections on Common Issues, Security Best Practices, Backup information, Getting Help, Removing SSH Access, Support and Contributing, Disclaimer, and License remains unchanged as it was accurate and helpful.
