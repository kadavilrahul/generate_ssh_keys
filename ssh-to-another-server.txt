To connect from Non root user to root user of another server

Open a terminal on the client machine (the machine you want to connect from).
1. ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096

This will generate two files:
~/.ssh/id_rsa: The private key (keep this secure and do not share it).
~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub: The public key (this will be shared with the server).

2. Remove any outdated or offending host key if present from your known_hosts file If error comes ERROR: It is also possible that a host key has just been changed.
ssh-keygen -f "/home/rahuldineshk/.ssh/known_hosts" -R "IP of the machine you want to connect to"

3. Try connecting to the remote server with password. This is for test only.
ssh root@server_ip
enter password
exit

4. Copy the public key to the server (the machine you want to connect to):
ssh-copy-id username@server_ip
enter password

5. Try connecting to th server without password
ssh root@server_ip
